#Myo_Edison_Haptics
==================

HackSC2014, using Myo to simulate virtual stimulation (hug) on another person (via haptics by Edison)

Current version only has a web based experience, Edison integration has not materialised as of yet. In order to run program note must have myo connect installed on computer along with a myo armband. 

##How it Works
User with a myo can simulate a hug, then send the statistics to a recipient 

##Credits
The idea of making a virtual hugging machine using haptic devices originated from Yay Shin: github.com/yayshine

I also adapted some html and css code from a project (github.com/yayshine.yourMood) that we on together in CalHacks 2014, this was to create login portion of page. This is noted in the index.html file

Math calculations is from Thalmic Labs's hello-myo.cpp sample code from myo-sdk-win-beta5 that I converted to javascript. This is noted in the index.html files
